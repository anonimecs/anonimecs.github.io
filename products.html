            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>The free version is designed for open source projects and small to medium size databases. 
                It supports the same anonymisation methods and the same unlimited database size as the enterprise editions. 
                It is limited, however to one database connection, disabling the possibility of cross database anonymisation available in the Enterprise editions. </p>
                
                <p>Your data anonymisation configurations will not be persisted to back end storage. Also, selective run of anonymisation methods are not supported. </p>
                
                <p>The above limitations are designed not to limit you using the tool for your single database. 
                You can still anonymize up to 15 tables at once, and use any level of sophistication designing your anonymisation masks. 
                During the anonymisation runs, you will profit from the same SQL optimizations as the enterprise edition, 
                allowing for anonymizing multi-million row databases in the matter of minutes. 
                Also, you can anonymize multiple schemas in the target database, and not limited to one schema only.</p>

                <p>The enterprise version offers all the features of the free software, with additional features for corporate use. </p>
                
                <p>Primarily, and most importantly, it will provide you with an SQL database to store your configuration. 
                This database can be accessed with standard database browser tools, allowing for script based configuration editing, 
                and regular backup of your configurations. </p>
                
                <p>Login based security ensures, that your configuration and data samples are only visible to authorized personnel. </p>
                
                <p>Cross database support allows for anonymizing the same data the same way in different databases along your data path. 
                Assume, your data capture database (DB1) feeds to data back end database (DB2) that in turn sends the data to the processing 
                database (DB3) which feeds down the processed data to some data warehouse (BD4). 
                All these databases will store your customer record for [Jane Doe, age 32], 
                and when Jane Doe is anonymized to [Paula Doe, age 30+] in one DB1, it should turn to [Paula Doe, age 30+] also on databases DB2, DB3 and DB4.</p>
                
                <p>Scheduling allows for regular re-anonymizing your data. 
                Say your scenario is user testing, where production close data is essential. 
                You may want to copy the production data you your test system every night, 
                and re-anonymize them with the same configuration. 
                Anonimecs scheduling extension can be triggered with the common solutions be it crontab, Autosys or UC4.</p>

                It allows for seamless integration to your corporate design, and allows for cost effective custom functionality,
                 like an LDAP authorization for the Anonimecs users in the GUI, or custom database login for databases with enterprise features enabled. </p>
