                <h2>Data Anonymization Basics</h2>
                <p>
	                <em>Data anonymization</em> is the process of either encrypting or removing personally identifiable information from data sets, so that the people whom the data describe remain anonymous. 
	                Data anonymization enables the transfer of information across a boundary, such as between two departments within an agency or between two agencies, 
	                while reducing the risk of unintended disclosure, and in certain environments in a manner that enables evaluation and analytics post-anonymization.
	                In the context of financial and medical data, anonymized data refers to data from which the client or patient cannot be identified by the recipient of the information. 
	                The name, address, and full post code must be removed together with any other information which, in conjunction with other data held by or disclosed to the recipient, could identify the entity.

                <h2>Anonymization Concepts</h2>
                <p>
                	<em>De-anonymization</em> is a strategy in which anonymous data is cross-referenced with other sources of data to re-identify the anonymous data source.
                </p>
                <p>
                	<em>De-identification</em> is the process used to prevent a personâ€™s identity from being connected with information. 
                	Common uses of de-identification include human subject research for the sake of privacy for research participants. 
                	Common strategies for de-identifying datasets are deleting or masking personal identifiers, 
                	such as name and social security number, and suppressing or generalizing quasi-identifiers, such as date of birth and zip code.
                	The reverse process of defeating de-identification to identify individuals is known as re-identification.
                	Anonymization refers to irreversibly severing a data set from the identity of the data contributor in a 
                	study to prevent any future re-identification, even by the study organizers under any condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                	<em>k-anonymity</em> is a property possessed by certain anonymized data. 
                	The concept of k-anonymity was first formulated by Latanya Sweeney in a paper published in 2002 as an attempt to solve the problem: 
                	"Given person-specific field-structured data, produce a release of the data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are 
                	the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful."
					A release of data is said to have the k-anonymity property if the information for each person contained 
					in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appear in the release.
                </p>
                <p>
                	<em>Non disclusure agreements</em> [NDA] are commonly used to protect sensitive data, and ensure regulatory complience. 
                	It must be understood, that NDAs are not a replacement for data anonymity. They present an ortoghonal concept to 
                	data protection, and should be - in most cases - acompanied by data protection measures, as encryption and anonymization. 
                </p>
                <p>
                	Companies should differentiate between <em>data encryption </em> and data anonymization. Encryption is the process of 
                	encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can read it. Most of the time, it involves data decryprion,
                	before the information can be used for its intended purpose.
                	Anonymisation, on the other hand, is a one way process. Certain data structures and properties must be kept, and the identifiability 
                	of the individuals must be prohibited.

                <h2>Anonymization Methods</h2>
                <p>
                	Anonimecs offers several anonymization methods, and its up to the user, to decide the level and combinations to use. 
                	It also intends to apply the anonymization over the complete domain of the data, ie. all columns of all tables that reference your data.
                	Emphasis is made on replicability of the anonymization, in order to refresh the data, and to iteratively remove potential weaknesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                	<em>Destroy</em> or wiping out part of the data, is the basic way of anomymisig data. Colums, that are not relevant for your anonymized data set, as the street name 
                	in a client record, can be wiped out, or - preferrably - replaced by some placeholder dummies.
				</p>
                <p>                	
                	<em>Encoding</em> a column with a seed (password) allows for tracing back the data for the password owners. 
                	This compromise of anonymity is sometimes desirable, as data errors or method errors may need to be traced back 
                	to the original de-anonymised data, to allows for error correction and data discrepancies elimination. 
				</p>
                <p>                	
                	<em>Reshuffle</em> is a method of re-shufflig your data, that allows for very good human readability, 
                	that is often required in testing or acceptance scenarios.  
                	Original values of the to be anonymized entities are replaced by a pseudo-random replacement value of all possible values 
                	in the domain. A seed (password) is used again to re-shuffle the values, hence de-anonymization for error analysis is possible 
                	for password owners.   
                </p>
